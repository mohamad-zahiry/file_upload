# file_upload

A file upload website with Django

---

## Use

```shell
$ python3 manage.py runserver <ip:port>
```

## note

The `ip` must be a local ip which can access from local network  
And also the other device(s) must be connected to the same network
Then, you can upload your files

## Motivation

- learn more about django
- common sharing-file apps are too slow :|
